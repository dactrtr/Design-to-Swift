# Design to SwiftUI

## I just moved the other projects to their own repos, the ones left here are the ones made in playgrounds, that somehow broke in a update from my laptop, maybe (not) I'll re do this views

This is a group of little **frontend** experiments I'm doing to improve and practice SwiftUI, saw something cool on the internet, BOOM! then try to code it. 

## What is in this repo

Here you will find ~~mostly, playground projects (I believe is a less complex approach rather than xcode) and a couple of~~ xcode projects(its way faster to work in xcode and you have access to the latest versions of SwiftUI, besides the errors are better handled in Xcode), ~~the playground projects comes bundled with the assets, I also leave a link to the a gist of each project, if it's a small enough and isn't a project with a lot of swift files (I'll do this sometimes)~~
