# Design to SwiftUI

This is a group of little **frontend** experiments I'm doing to improve and practice SwiftUI, saw something cool on the internet, BOOM! then try to code it. 

## What is in this repo

Here you will find mostly, playground projects (I believe is a less complex approach rather than xcode) and a couple of xcode projects, the playground projects comes bundled with the assets, I also leave a link to the a gist of each project, if it's a small enough and isn't a project with a lot of swift files (I'll do this sometimes)
